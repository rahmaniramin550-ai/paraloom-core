//! Unified-transact verification consensus (#350).

//! Circuit-v3 settlement consensus. A client submits a
//! unified transact (two input nullifiers, two output commitments, the
//! membership root, a signed external flow, and a `TransactCircuitV3` proof);
//! validators verify the proof and vote, and once a BFT quorum of eligible
//! voters agrees the coordinator emits an [`ApprovedTransact`] that a
//! submitter task settles on-chain via the unified `transact` instruction.
//!
//! The vote/quorum machinery is shared with withdrawals through
//! [`VoteTally`]; this module only adds the transact-specific request,
//! approval, and the thin coordinator shell. The reputation/slashing/leader
//! trackers are reused as-is, so a validator's standing is consistent across
//! all verification paths.
